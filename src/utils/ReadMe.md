In React projects, the utils folder is a common convention for storing utility functions, helper modules, and other reusable pieces of code that don't necessarily fit into a specific component or page.

## Common examples of what you might put in a utils folder:
# Helper functions:
Functions that perform common tasks like formatting dates, validating input, manipulating strings, or making API calls.
# Constants:
A central place to store constants and configuration values used throughout the application.
# Custom hooks:
Reusable hooks that encapsulate complex logic or state management.
# Utility components:
Small, reusable components that don't have their own state or complex logic, such as a loading spinner or a button with custom styling.
