In React, the pages folder is a common convention for organizing components that represent different routes or views in your application.
Here's what you need to know:
# Purpose:
The pages folder acts as a clear separation between route-level components and other reusable components. This makes it easier to navigate your project and understand the structure of your application's routes.
# File Structure:
Each file in the pages folder typically represents a single route or page in your application. For example, you might have files like Home.js, About.js, Contact.js, and so on.
# Routing:
When using a routing library like React Router, the file names in the pages folder often directly correspond to the URL paths in your application.
